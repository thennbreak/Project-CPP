# C++ Efficiency Project
This C++ project tests the efficiecny of data structures and pointers.  The 3 data structures include a stack built on an array, a static array, and a heap built on an array.  They are measured by declaring each structure a large amount of times and clocking how long it takes to do so.  This is done in the eff.cpp file.

Also included in this project is a C++ program that intializes a 2D array that creates a multiplication table.  It was created to compare the efficiency of no pointers vs using pointers.  Both correspoding files are 2D
