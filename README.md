# C++ Effiecieny Project
This C++ project tests the effiecieny of data structures and pointers.  The 3 data structures include a stack built on an array, a static array, and a heap built on an array.  Also included in this project is a C++ program that intializes a 2D array that creates a multiplication table.  It was created to compare the effiecieny of no pointers vs using pointers.
